# enlist new contributors

Helping us to run those endless tasks will let developpers more time
to focus on the code. so please do your best and ask us if you're stuck
at some point

* blog about sympa (in any language, for anything worth to share)

  not only to make all the world know that sympa is alive and cool
  but it's a good way to give some perspectives on how sympa is used
  (good readling for the developpers)

* provide support on the sympa-users mailing list

  * finding venues
  * organize, invite

* translate

  having an up to date translation both for UX and documentation
  is very important for a successfull project.

  cash should help to organize events (trainings, hackathons, ...)
  as well as running servers for the project.
