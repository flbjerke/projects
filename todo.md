# community

* blog about sympa (in any language, for anything worth to share)

  not only to make all the world know that sympa is alive and cool
  but it's a good way to give some perspectives on how sympa is used
  (good readling for the developpers)

* provide support on the sympa-users mailing list

* help us to run hackathons and meetings
  * find venues
  * organize, invite
  * spread the world using blogs, mailing lists and social networks

* run betas and give us feebacks
  any kind of feedback (UX, install and run, perfs, ...)

* translate

  having an up to date translation both for UX and documentation
  is very important for a successfull project.

* fund rising

  cash should help to organize events (trainings, hackathons, ...)
  as well as running servers for the project.
